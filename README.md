# FMCS Work Stoppage–Related Records

In December 2022, the [Data Liberation Project](https://www.data-liberation-project.org/) submitted a [FOIA request](https://www.data-liberation-project.org/requests/fmcs-work-stoppages/) to the [Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service](https://www.fmcs.gov/) (FMCS) seeking:

1. Database records describing the general characteristics of all FMCS-tracked work stoppages.
2. All documentation of [FMCS-0004](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/03/16/2022-05544/privacy-act-of-1974-system-of-records), the “system of records” containing that information.

On February 9, 2023, FMCS’s FOIA office [responded](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23622117-2023-02-09-foia-partial-grant) with a “partial grant,” providing the Data Liberation Project with just one documentation file, and withholding all other records. “There are 733 pages of records fully redacted under FOIA Exemption 4 and 6,” according the agency’s letter.

The Data Liberation Project intends to appeal the decision.

In the meantime, we’re [uploading the one file](schema/raw/) the agency did provide: An Excel spreadsheet named “Prod Schema.xlsx”. Although FMCS did not provide any context for the file when providing it, it appears to be the database schema for [FMCS-0004](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/03/16/2022-05544/privacy-act-of-1974-system-of-records)’s case management system, or at least a portion of it.

We have also converted the Excel file into a CSV file (with all Excel sheets concatenated into a single table), which you can find [here](schema/converted/prod-schema.csv). 

We claim no copyright over either the raw or converted files, and are releasing them into the public domain.

The Data Liberation Project welcomes your observations and questions, which you can submit [here](https://github.com/data-liberation-project/fmcs-work-stoppage-records/discussions) or [via email](https://www.data-liberation-project.org/contact/).
